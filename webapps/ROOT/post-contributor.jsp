                   <strong> Tips:</strong>
                    <P>Comments regarding seasonal events such as the opening of leaves or flowers in the spring and onset of leaf fall in autumn are of particular interest to researchers. Changes in the timing of these events have important consequences for the health of our environment and more observations contribute to better understanding at the local, regional and global scales.</P>
                    <p>High-quality comments will help others to search for specific pictures or plants or events long into the future.
                    <ul><strong>Sample Comments</strong>
                    <li><strong>Reference Set: </strong> Label the reference set with items of interest in each of your pictures, such as "oak trees" or "lake".
                    <li><strong>Individual Pictures: </strong> Useful comments in individual pictures are "oak tree leaves are turning fall color, about half of the leaves are turned", or "the sky is overcast", or "the grass looks dry after two weeks without rain".
