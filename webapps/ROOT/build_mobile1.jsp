       <H3>Construction Tip!</H3>
  <p class=clearfix>Consider purchasing a plastic lumber post top - it will last for many years with no maintenance! The plastic top can be drilled just like wood, or attached to an existing structure.

            <UL>
              <LI>Any thin pieces of wood, 3/8&quot; plywood would be ideal: I used 5&quot; x 1/2&quot; scrap cedar lumber that I had on hand.
              <LI>Screws: 2 each, 1/4&quot; lag bolts with a hex head, or other bolts that can be securely tightened such as phillips or regular screws.
                      (Sheet metal screws with a nut and lock may work well, too.)
              <LI>Small bubble level to attach to post top (see picture at right); compass, GPS, or smartphone with compass and GPS.                    
              <LI>Octagon template (<a href="/resources/pictureposttemplate9in.pdf">you can download it here</a>) or Plastic lumber post top (<a href="/buy.jsp">you can order one here</a>).

            <UL>
              <LI>I made a 6"x6" box out of extra cedar I had with 4- 1 1/2" long  1/4" carriage bolts that serve as "set screws" so that the box can be leveled even on a leaning post and still be secure enough to take good photographs.
             <li>I then made the octagonal template out of some hard pressed board which was secured with a single screw and nut in the center so that it could be rotated to true north (for maximum flexibility).        
             <li>This should work for quite a wide variety of potential posts.  This one can attach to either round or square posts from around 6" to less than 4" in diameter.
