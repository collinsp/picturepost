<H2 align=center>What Does a Post Owner Do?</h2>
  It is a great feeling to get a new Picture Post in the ground! </br></br>
  The value of any post is in the commitment of people to take pictures on a regular basis and for many years. It is not always easy to keep up the initial excitement, but we hope that the Picture Post network will offer incentives and provide participants with valuable information that will be rewarding as the network grows and matures.</P>
